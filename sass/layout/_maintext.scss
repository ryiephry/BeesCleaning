// plans for website 
// the delete sentinces over the image " " , and then 
// for the service section , a lightbox of each service and then text sliding in 
// from left as you scroll down and a litle text about us being careful and experienced 
// at this service 

// for footer need to set up some sort of node cloud service maybe pay 1$ a month / aws 
// and have it hosted, buy a domain and have the texts / leads sent to my number 
// 

// in detail 

// for the front page 
// the images should have a slow slide and fade in-out , left to right like a card going
// over another card that only works when in view so its not playing when your bythe footer
// the images will most likely be taken from an array in a js file 
//
// for services 
// for the "our services" text it should slide in as well 
// i want the text to slice in to the middle form the left as you scroll 
// and have a very smooth motion and not to fast 
// the images by each service block should be able to scroll to the right through touch but 
// scroll every 2 seconds automaticly 
//
